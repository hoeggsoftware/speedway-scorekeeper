I will provide two text samples, and I'm requesting that you provide a numerical score for the similarity between how the samples are pronounced by the likely authors.  The samples are the output of a separate transcription API, and my goal is to assess how similar the original speech pronunciations are likely to be.  I will provide the samples in XML.  Provide your output as a decimal number between 0 and 10, where 10 means that the pronunciations are certain to be identical, and 0 means there is no chance that the audio samples contain the same words.  Do not provide any output aside from the number, and do not explain your answer. <sample-1>#[vars.name1]</sample-1><sample-2>#[vars.name2]</sample-2>
